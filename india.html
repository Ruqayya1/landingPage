        <p class="para">The word Hindustan comes from the word Sind (Indus) a riverthat flowsthrough the Indus valley.
            It got distorted from Sind to Hind. The country was named Hindustan, and the people living in the Indus
            valley were called Hindustani. The religion they practice is called Hinduism and individual who believes in
            that philosophy of life is called a Hindu.</p>

                <p>Indian cuisine has an added bonus for vegetarians: For them, itâ€™s one of the friendliest cuisines
                    around. Judicious use of spices and sauces breathes new life into the likes of potatoes,
                    cauliflower, peas, and eggplant. And a meal of hearty-but-healthy palak paneer (a
                    spinach-and-cheese dish) with a side of naan (a pita-type leavened flat bread) will convert even
                    the biggest meat lovers.</p>
